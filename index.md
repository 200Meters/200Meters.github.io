### **Knight Moves**

> _"In chess, the knight operates strategically from the center of the board. It’s the innovative nonlinear moving piece which freely jumps over other pieces and opponents to reach its destination – unhindered by the constraints that block the movement of other pieces, achieving what’s impossible to them. Inequality has divided us, leaving people behind without hope for their future. Knight Moves empowers rural and urban underserved populations to move nonlinearly and jump the barriers blocking their socioeconomic inclusion."_
