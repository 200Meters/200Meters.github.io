### Time Series Analysis
Time series analysis is useful in a number of disciplines, financial, economics, healthcare, operations. Traditional time series analysis has relied on statistical techniques which tend to focus on auto-correlation: the correlation of the time series with itself. With the advent of neural networks and machine learning, it opens other possibilities for time series forecasting. This post explores a few of those methods in the context of the DrivenData machine learning competition DengAI.
